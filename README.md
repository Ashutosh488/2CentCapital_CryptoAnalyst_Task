# TaskSheet for Crypto Analyst Intern
## Task 1: Crypto Fund Management

### Scenario:
As a newly appointed manager of a $1 million crypto fund, your goal is to outperform the market with a diversified, high-yield portfolio. You are expected to utilize advanced strategies beyond simple buy-and-hold. Consider the full spectrum of opportunities in the crypto ecosystem.

### Task:
#### 1. Portfolio Construction:
Design a diversified portfolio allocating $1 million across various crypto assets and complex investment vehicles. Explore multiple opportunities like delta-neutral strategies, DeFi yields, etc.

#### 2. Detailed Performance Metrics:
For each investment, calculate and explain:
- **APR and APY**.
- **Volatility** (Standard Deviation of Returns) as a measure of risk.
- **Value at Risk (VaR)** at a 95% confidence level to estimate potential loss.
- **Beta relative to Bitcoin or another major index** to gauge sensitivity to broader market movements.
- Are there any other metrics you can come up with?

#### 3. Risk Management Plan:
Develop a comprehensive risk management plan, including:
- **Hedging techniques** (e.g., options, futures).
- **Diversification** across blockchains, protocols, and asset types.
- **Risk mitigation** for specific exposures like smart contract risk, counterparty risk, and regulatory risk.
- Create a **Stress Test scenario analysis** (e.g., 30% market crash, DeFi protocol exploit) to evaluate portfolio resilience.

#### 4. Scenario-Based Strategy Adjustments:
Outline how your portfolio and strategies would adjust under different market conditions (e.g., bull, bear, sideways, high volatility).

#### Deliverables:
- A **comprehensive report** detailing your portfolio construction, risk assessments, and strategy adjustments.
- A **dashboard or visualization** (can be built using Python, Excel, or another tool) to track key metrics and simulate stress test outcomes.

## Task 2: Python-Based Strategy Development and Backtesting

### Scenario:
Develop and implement an advanced crypto trading strategy using Python incorporating complex indicators, risk management, and multi-timeframe analysis. Your strategy should suit both bull and bear markets with a straightforward approach to adapting to market conditions.

### Task:

#### 1. Strategy Implementation:
Develop a Python script that implements a trading strategy.

#### 2. Advanced Backtesting:
- Backtest your strategy on historical data for the given datasets in the discord.
- Evaluate performance using advanced metrics.

#### 3. Parameter Optimization:
- Use Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization techniques to fine-tune your strategy parameters.
- Avoid overfitting by validating your strategy on **out-of-sample data** and using **walk-forward optimization**.

#### 4. Implementation of Risk Management:
- Implement **position sizing rules**.
- Integrate **dynamic stop-loss** and **take-profit levels** based on market conditions.

#### 5. Performance Reporting and Visualization:
- Generate a report summarizing the strategy performance, including key metrics and visualizations.
- Include plots of the **equity curve**, **drawdowns**, and **indicator signals**.

#### Deliverables:
- Python code implementing the strategy, backtests, and optimization for all assets given.
- A **detailed report** with findings, strategy performance, and potential improvements.

## Task 3: Smart Contract Development Task

#### Objective:
To assess the candidate’s ability to develop smart contracts that interact with off-chain data, manage token behavior dynamically, and create engaging, real-world applications in the DeFi space.

#### Instructions:
Choose one of the following tasks. You are encouraged to use any language and any blockchain platform.

### Option 1: Automated Stablecoin

#### Objective:
Develop a smart contract for an **automated stablecoin** that maintains its peg by adjusting the supply based on real-time price data.

#### Requirements:
- Use an off-chain price feeder like the Pyth network to obtain real-time price data for your stablecoin.
- Implement logic in the smart contract to:
  - **Burn tokens** when the price increases (to reduce supply and lower price).
  - **Mint tokens** when the price decreases (to increase supply and raise price).
- Include functions for **initializing, burning, and minting tokens**, with necessary access control (e.g., only certain roles can call the burn/mint functions).
- Provide clear documentation on how your contract maintains stability, including the triggers and thresholds for burning/minting.

#### Deliverables:
- The **smart contract code** with comments explaining key sections.
- A deployment script (if applicable) and instructions for testing the contract on a testnet are needed.
- A short **report or readme** explaining the logic, design choices, and how the contract maintains the stablecoin’s peg.

### Option 2: Prediction Market Smart Contract

#### Objective:
Create a **prediction market smart contract** where users can predict the future price movement of a token and earn rewards based on their predictions.

#### Requirements:
- Use an off-chain price feeder like the Pyth network to fetch the real-time price of a token pair like BTC/USDT.
- Implement a prediction market where users can:
  - Place bets predicting whether the price will go **up or down** within a specific interval (e.g., 1 hour, 24 hours).
  - Use a simple mechanism for users to enter predictions and stake tokens.
- At the end of each prediction interval:
  - Fetch the latest price and compare it to the starting price of the interval.
  - **Distribute rewards** to users who predicted correctly based on their staked amount.
- Include basic error handling, access controls, and a mechanism to ensure fair distribution of rewards.

#### Deliverables:
- The **smart contract code** with inline comments to explain key functionalities.
- A deployment script (if applicable) and instructions for interacting with the contract on a testnet.
- A **concise report or readme** describing the contract’s functions, how the prediction mechanism works, and the logic behind reward distribution.

### Tips:
- **Keep it Simple**: Focus on the core functionality and avoid overcomplicating the implementation.
- **Security Considerations**: Include basic security measures such as input validation, correct access control, and protections against common vulnerabilities.
- **Testing**: Provide test cases or scripts demonstrating the contract’s essential functions, ensuring they behave as expected.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Correctness and functionality** of the smart contract.
- **Code quality**, readability, and use of best practices.
- Ability to **integrate off-chain data** securely and accurately.
- **Clarity and completeness** of the documentation.
- **Innovation and effectiveness** in addressing the task requirements.

---

## Submission Guidelines:
- **Code Repository**: Submit all code, reports, and supporting documents via GitHub Classroom.
- **Documentation**: Include a README file with instructions on how to run your code, specify dependencies, and detail setup requirements.
- **Video Walkthrough**: Provide a 10-15 minute video walkthrough explaining your approach, key insights, and overall development process.
- **Report**: Submit a report summarizing your strategies, findings, and recommendations tailored for a technical audience.
